    "Reasoning on discarding unnecessary fields:\n",
    "* 'PPG' (Fantasy points per game) is derived from other fields and can be discarded.\n",

    "* The Player's Name and Team will be kept for display, but when training the model we will discard this because we don't want the model trying to guess based on the name of the player. There are repeat names in this dataset. For example, this dataset will include RB Derek Henry in all 4 of his years. We don't want the model picking up on names like this and trying to use that to guess the players position."
